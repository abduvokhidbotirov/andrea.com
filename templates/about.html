                            <p>I have worked with Scottish bloggers for over 5 years and in that time became one myself. My Scottish food blog also focuses on fashion and travel in America, Asia, Europe and beyond but have a love of photography which sees me visiting the Highlands regularly. My passion is writing so I focus on blogging and back links supported by social, rather than the other way around.
